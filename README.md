## 📁 File Structure

```
trading_terminal.py    # Main application file
trade_log.csv         # Auto-generated trade history (created on first run)
README.md            # This documentation file
```

- **Prediction Expiry**: 1 minute (signal duration)

## 🔍 How It Works

### Market Simulation
The terminal simulates realistic market conditions using:
- Mathematical wave functions for natural price movement
- Random noise for market volatility
- Historical price tracking for indicator calculations

### AI Signal Generation
Signals are generated based on:
- MACD crossover patterns
- RSI overbought/oversold conditions
- Moving average relationships
- Market momentum analysis

### Performance Tracking
Each trade is automatically:
- Logged with entry price and timestamp
- Tracked until expiry (1 minute default)
- Evaluated as HIT, MISS, or NEUTRAL
- Saved to CSV file for permanent record

## 📊 Data Logging

All trades are automatically logged to `trade_log.csv` with:
- Unique Trade ID
- Timestamp
- Signal type
- Confidence level
- Entry and exit prices
- Final result status

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Install required dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy`

**Chart not displaying:**
- Resize the window to trigger chart refresh
- Restart automation if chart appears frozen

**CSV file errors:**
