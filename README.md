# üöÄ Pro AI Trading Terminal v14.0

### **An AI-Powered Simulated Trading Platform**

This is a Python desktop application that serves as an educational tool for exploring automated trading strategies and technical analysis. Built with **Tkinter** for the graphical interface, it simulates a live market and uses a simple AI to generate trading signals based on real-time indicator data.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Realistic Market Simulation**: The application generates a live price feed that mimics real market volatility, providing a safe environment to test trading concepts.
  * **AI-Powered Predictions**: A rule-based AI analyzes key technical indicators to generate actionable trading signals like **BUY CALL**, **BUY PUT**, or **HOLD**.
  * **Comprehensive Dashboard**: The UI features a dashboard displaying live price, OHLC data, and the real-time values of indicators like **RSI**, **ADX**, and **MACD**.
  * **Trade History**: A dedicated panel tracks and logs all predictions, their entry prices, final outcomes (**HIT** or **MISS**), and other details to a CSV file.
  * **Multithreaded Performance**: The market simulation runs on a separate thread, ensuring the application's user interface remains responsive and smooth.
